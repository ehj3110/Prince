```
Data Points: 2,260 successfully processed
Layers: 3/3 peaks correctly detected at 12.48s, 33.91s, 56.27s
Metrics: Peak forces 0.243N, 0.261N, 0.262N
Output: Professional 1.4MB comprehensive plots
Status: User approved quality ✅
```

#### **✅ Complete Documentation Package**
- **Technical Report**: `HYBRID_SYSTEM_SUCCESS_REPORT.md` - Complete project documentation
- **Backup Guide**: `HYBRID_SYSTEM_BACKUP_MANIFEST.md` - Restoration instructions
- **Project Update**: `PROJECT_UPDATE_HYBRID_SYSTEM.md` - System-wide adoption guide
- **Usage Examples**: Comprehensive demonstration code
