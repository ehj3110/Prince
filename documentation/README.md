## Document Relationships
1. The scientific methodology in `WORK_OF_ADHESION_METRICS_DEFINITIONS.md` is implemented in the calculator as documented in `UNIFIED_CALCULATOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
2. The layer boundary detection algorithm in `LAYER_BOUNDARY_DETECTION.md` is used by the post-print analysis system described in `POST_PRINT_ANALYSIS_INTEGRATION.md`
3. Project updates in `PROJECT_UPDATE_HYBRID_SYSTEM.md` reference the implementation details from other technical documents

## How to Use This Documentation
1. Start with `PROJECT_UPDATE_HYBRID_SYSTEM.md` for the latest system status
2. Refer to `WORK_OF_ADHESION_METRICS_DEFINITIONS.md` for scientific methodology
3. Check `UNIFIED_CALCULATOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for implementation details
4. Use `LAYER_BOUNDARY_DETECTION.md` for understanding data processing
5. Review `HYBRID_SYSTEM_SUCCESS_REPORT.md` for complete project context
