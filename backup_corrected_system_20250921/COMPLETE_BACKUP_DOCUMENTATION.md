- `hybrid_adhesion_plotter.py` - Corrected plotter (light smoothing)
- `test_adhesion_calculator_with_derivatives.py` - Analysis tool
- `batch_process_printing_data.py` - Batch processing utility

### COMPLETE SUPPORT MODULES ‚úÖ
- `support_modules/` - ENTIRE directory backed up (36 files)
  - `PeakForceLogger.py` - Work of adhesion logging
  - `SensorDataWindow.py` - GUI components  
  - `AutoHomeRoutine.py` - Printer homing
  - `AutomatedLayerLogger.py` - Layer logging
  - `ForceGaugeManager.py` - Force sensor management
  - `enhanced_adhesion_metrics.py` - Enhanced analysis
  - And all other support files + compiled Python caches

### DOCUMENTATION ‚úÖ
- `SMOOTHING_CORRECTION_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Technical explanation
- `FINAL_STATUS_REPORT.md` - System status summary

## CLEANUP COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### REMOVED FILES (9 files, 20,256 bytes freed)
The following debugging/comparison files were removed as they are no longer needed:

#### Comparison Scripts ‚ùå (Problem Resolved)
- `compare_calculators.py` - Used to compare old vs new calculator
- `compare_time_data.py` - Used to compare time calculations  
- `simple_compare.py` - Simple comparison utility
- `direct_prop_end_compare.py` - Direct propagation end comparison
- `final_calculator_comparison.py` - Final comparison test

#### Temporary Fix Scripts ‚ùå (Superseded)
- `replicate_hybrid_plotter.py` - Temporary debugging script
- `run_normal_plotter.py` - Old plotter runner
- `run_fixed_plotter.py` - Temporary fix runner
- `check_boundaries.py` - Empty debugging file

### RETAINED IMPORTANT FILES ‚úÖ
- `Prince_Segmented.py` (62,896 bytes) - Main printer software
- `adhesion_metrics_calculator.py` (24,354 bytes) - Corrected calculator
- `hybrid_adhesion_plotter.py` (26,735 bytes) - Corrected plotter  
- `test_adhesion_calculator_with_derivatives.py` (14,977 bytes) - Analysis tool
- `batch_process_printing_data.py` (30,272 bytes) - Batch processing
- `final_layer_visualization.py` (28,172 bytes) - Specialized visualization

## SYSTEM STATUS
üü¢ **FULLY BACKED UP** - Complete system preserved in backup folder
üü¢ **CLEANED UP** - Workspace focused on working production code
üü¢ **READY FOR USE** - All corrected files operational

## WHY FILES WERE REMOVED
The removed comparison and test files were created during the smoothing parameter debugging session. Since the problem is now **resolved** with corrected light smoothing settings (window=3, polyorder=1), these debugging tools are no longer needed:

- Propagation end calculations are now accurate (~11.7s ‚úÖ)
- All components use consistent light smoothing settings ‚úÖ  
- System is verified and tested ‚úÖ

## RESTORE INSTRUCTIONS
If you ever need to restore the complete system:
1. Copy everything from `backup_corrected_system_20250921/` to main directory
2. Ensure `support_modules/` is properly copied
3. All settings and corrections will be preserved
