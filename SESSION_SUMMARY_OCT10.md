# Summary - October 10, 2025 Session

## Critical Fix Applied ✅

### Propagation End Detection - CORRECTED

**Problem Found:** On October 1, 2025, the adhesion calculator was completely rewritten and the propagation end detection method was changed to an incorrect algorithm.

**Root Cause:** The Oct 1 rewrite used "find peaks in 2nd derivative and select the last one" instead of the correct method: "find where 2nd derivative returns to zero after its maximum."

### The Correct Method (Now Implemented)

```
1. Calculate 2nd derivative of force
2. Find MAXIMUM of 2nd derivative (highest curvature point)
3. Find where 2nd derivative crosses ZERO after that maximum
4. Zero-crossing = propagation end (force has stabilized)
```

**Physical Meaning:**
- Maximum 2nd derivative = fastest force decay (crack propagating most rapidly)
- Zero-crossing after = force curve flattens (propagation complete, baseline reached)

### Method History

| Date | Method | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Sept 22, 2025 | Find max of 2nd derivative, use that point | ⚠️ Close but incomplete |
| Oct 1, 2025 | Find peaks, select last peak before 90% | ❌ Wrong - no physical meaning |
| **Oct 10, 2025** | **Find max of 2nd derivative, then find zero-crossing** | **✅ CORRECT** |

### Expected Impact

Your results should now be MORE accurate:
- ✅ Propagation end detected at true baseline (not arbitrary peak)
- ✅ Work of adhesion will be higher (integrating to actual endpoint)
- ✅ Baseline force will be lower (closer to zero)
- ✅ More consistent across different speeds/viscosities

## Workspace Cleanup Completed ✅

### Files Deleted
- **Test files:** 20+ test scripts and outputs from root directory
- **Redundant batch processors:** 7 old/failed batch processing scripts
- **Duplicate files:** analysis_plotter, raw_data_processor from root
- **Old support modules:** PeakForceLogger_Old.py, SensorDataWindow_Old.py
- **Backup folders:** 2 complete system backup folders (Sept 21)
- **Total reduction:** ~80% of files removed

### Files Organized
- Consolidated `archived_files/` → `archive/`
- Test data moved to `archive/test_data/`
- Test scripts moved to `archive/test_scripts/`
- Clean root directory structure

### Code Refactored
- **RawData_Processor.py:** Removed all plotting (pure data processing)
- **batch_process_steppedcone.py:** Added colors, V2 support, crash prevention
- **adhesion_metrics_calculator.py:** FIXED propagation end detection

## What Changed in Your Code

### File: `support_modules/adhesion_metrics_calculator.py`
**Method:** `_find_propagation_end_reverse_search()`

**Before (Oct 1 - WRONG):**
```python
# Find peaks in 2nd derivative
peaks_indices = []
for i in range(1, len(second_derivative) - 1):
    if second_derivative[i] > neighbors:
        peaks_indices.append(i)

# Take LAST peak (arbitrary!)
last_peak_relative_idx = valid_peaks[-1]
propagation_end_idx = peak_idx + last_peak_relative_idx
```

**After (Oct 10 - CORRECT):**
```python
# Find MAXIMUM of 2nd derivative (highest curvature)
max_second_deriv_idx = np.argmax(second_derivative)

# Find where it returns to ZERO after maximum
for i in range(max_second_deriv_idx + 1, len(second_derivative)):
    if second_derivative[i] <= 0:
        zero_crossing_idx = i
        break
    # Also check if close to zero (within 5%)
    if abs(second_derivative[i]) < 0.05 * abs(second_derivative[max_second_deriv_idx]):
        zero_crossing_idx = i
        break

propagation_end_idx = peak_idx + zero_crossing_idx
```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test the fix:**
   ```bash
   python diagnose_propagation_end.py post-processing/autolog_L48-L50.csv
   ```
   This will show you where propagation end is now being detected.

2. **Re-process your V2 data:**
   ```bash
   python batch_process_steppedcone.py
   ```
   Results should now be more accurate with correct propagation detection.

3. **Compare results:**
   - Check if work of adhesion values make more sense
   - Verify baseline forces are closer to zero
   - Look for more consistent results across conditions

4. **Visual inspection:**
   - Plot force vs time with propagation end marked
   - Verify it's at the "flat" part where force has stabilized
   - Should look physically reasonable

## Status

✅ **Cleanup complete** - Workspace organized, redundant files removed  
✅ **Critical bug fixed** - Propagation end detection corrected  
✅ **Documentation complete** - Full explanation of changes  
✅ **Git commits done** - All changes tracked and committed  

Your code should now be calculating adhesion metrics correctly using the physically meaningful zero-crossing method you originally intended!
