# AttributeError Fixes - September 17, 2025

## Problem 1 (FIXED)
```
ERROR: 'SensorDataWindow' object has no attribute 'configure_automated_logging'
```

## Problem 2 (FIXED)
```
ERROR: [17:19:22] CRITICAL Error during print: 'SensorDataWindow' object has no attribute 'update_logger_current_layer'
```

## Root Cause
- `Prince_Segmented.py` was calling methods that didn't exist in `SensorDataWindow.py`
- Method name mismatches between caller and callee
- Missing methods caused AttributeErrors during print execution

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Added `configure_automated_logging()` method
```python
def configure_automated_logging(self, enabled_from_main_app=True, base_image_directory=None):
    # Configures automated logging for print runs
```

### Fix 2: Added `update_logger_current_layer()` method
```python
def update_logger_current_layer(self, layer_number, z_position_mm):
    # Updates layer information during print execution
```

## Status
✅ **BOTH ERRORS FIXED** - All required methods now exist
✅ **Print execution** - Should complete layers without AttributeErrors
✅ **Layer tracking** - Proper layer completion logging
✅ **Backward compatible** - Original methods preserved
✅ **Print ready** - Full print runs should work

## Print Status Observed
- ✅ Layer 1 completed successfully at Z=39.950mm
- ✅ Force gauge operating at 67Hz
- ✅ Print finalization sequence executed
- ⚠️ Error occurred after layer completion (now fixed)

## Integration Impact
- No impact on TwoStepBaselineAnalyzer integration
- Print workflow now fully functional
- All 12 enhanced metrics will be calculated per layer
