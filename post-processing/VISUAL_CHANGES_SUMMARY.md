```
Individual Points:
  ○ All data points plotted
  ○ 90% transparent (alpha=0.05)
  ○ Hard to see density patterns
  ○ Cluttered appearance

Mean/Median Markers:

  ● 75% transparent (alpha=0.25)
  ● No error information
  ● Visually dominant

Trendlines:
  ─── Polynomial fit (2nd order)

  ─── 80% opacity
```

### AFTER (New System) ✅
```
Individual Points:
  ✗ NOT SHOWN (removed for clarity)

Mean/Median Markers:
  ● Small circles/squares (size=6)
  ● 80% opacity (easier to see)
  ● ERROR BARS included

Trendlines:
  ─── Polynomial fit (2nd order)
  ─── Dashed line
  ─── 60% opacity (less dominant)
  ─── Fits to mean/median, not individual points
```

## 📊 Error Bar Types

### Mean Plots (Use SEM)
```
       ▲
       │
    ───┼───  ← Error bar = ± SEM
       │
       ●      ← Mean value
       │
    ───┼───
       │
       ▼

SEM = Standard Deviation / √n
Smaller bars = More confident in mean
```

### Median Plots (Use IQR)
```
       ▲
       │
    ───┼───  ← Upper error = Q3 - Median
       │
       ■      ← Median value (square marker)
       │
    ───┼───  ← Lower error = Median - Q1
       │
       ▼

IQR shows middle 50% of data
Smaller bars = Less variability
```

## 📊 Statistical Improvements

### Error Quantification

**OLD SYSTEM:**
```
No error bars
No confidence intervals
No indication of data quality
Cannot assess measurement precision
```

**NEW SYSTEM:**
```
✓ SEM error bars on mean plots
  → Shows precision of mean estimate
  → Smaller bars = more reliable mean

✓ IQR error bars on median plots
  → Shows data variability
  → Smaller bars = more consistent data

✓ Outlier filtering applied
  → Removes bad measurements automatically
  → Improves statistical validity
```

## 🔢 Example Data Interpretation

### Reading a Mean Plot with Error Bars
```
      0.30 ┤
           │     ╷
      0.25 ┤     ●  ← Mean = 0.25N, SEM = ±0.02N
           │     ╵
      0.20 ┤
           └─────────────
           10    15    20 mm/min

Interpretation:
- Average peak force at 15 mm/min is 0.25N
- If we repeat this experiment, the mean would
  likely fall between 0.23N and 0.27N (68% confidence)
- Small error bars = consistent measurements ✓
```

### Reading a Median Plot with Error Bars
```
      0.30 ┤
           │        ╷
      0.25 ┤     ╷  │
           │     ■  │  ← Median = 0.23N
      0.20 ┤     ╵  │     Q1 = 0.22N, Q3 = 0.28N
           │        ╵
      0.15 ┤
           └─────────────
           10    15    20 mm/min

Interpretation:
- Typical peak force at 15 mm/min is 0.23N
- 50% of measurements fall between 0.22N and 0.28N
- Asymmetric bars = skewed distribution
```

## 🔍 Outlier Filtering Visualization

### Before Filtering
```
Data Points: ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●̲ ● ● (one outlier ●̲)
                                ↑
                           pulls mean up
                           inflates error bars

Mean: 0.25 (affected by outlier)
Std Dev: 0.08 (inflated)
```

### After IQR Filtering
```
Data Points: ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● (outlier removed)

Mean: 0.23 (true average)
Std Dev: 0.02 (realistic)
```

**Result:** More accurate statistics, cleaner plots

## 📝 File Naming Convention

### OLD SYSTEM
```
MASTER_speed_analysis.png        (mean only)
MASTER_distance_analysis.png     (median only)

Problem: Mixed aggregation methods, unclear
```

### NEW SYSTEM
```
MASTER_speed_mean_analysis.png       ← Clear: Mean with SEM
MASTER_speed_median_analysis.png     ← Clear: Median with IQR
MASTER_distance_mean_analysis.png    ← Clear: Mean with SEM
MASTER_distance_median_analysis.png  ← Clear: Median with IQR

Advantage: Filename tells you exactly what you're looking at!
```

## 🎯 Use Case Guide

### When to Use MEAN Plots
```
✓ Data is normally distributed
✓ Few/no outliers after filtering
✓ Scientific publication
✓ Want to show statistical precision
✓ Reporting average behavior

Example: "The mean peak force was 0.25 ± 0.02 N (SEM, n=15)"
```

### When to Use MEDIAN Plots
```
✓ Data has outliers (even after filtering)
✓ Skewed distribution
✓ Small sample sizes
✓ Want to show typical behavior
✓ Preliminary data exploration

Example: "The median peak force was 0.23 N (IQR: 0.22-0.28 N, n=15)"
```

**Best Practice:** Generate both, choose the most appropriate for your needs!

## ⚡ Performance Comparison

### Processing Time
```
OLD: ~5-10 seconds per condition
NEW: ~6-12 seconds per condition

Increase: ~20% (due to outlier filtering)
Worth it: ✅ Better data quality!
```

### Plot Generation Time
```
OLD: 2 plots × 2 seconds = 4 seconds
NEW: 4 plots × 2 seconds = 8 seconds

Increase: 4 seconds
Benefit: Comprehensive analysis with both mean and median
```

## 🎓 Scientific Justification

### Why Remove Individual Points?

**Edward Tufte (Data Visualization Expert):**
> "Above all else show the data"

**BUT ALSO:**
> "Maximize data-ink ratio" - Remove unnecessary visual elements

**Our Implementation:**
- Data IS shown (via means/medians)
- Error bars show data spread
- Trendlines show relationships
- Cleaner = easier to interpret ✓

### Why Both Mean and Median?

**Statistical Best Practice:**
- Mean: Efficient estimator for normal distributions
- Median: Robust estimator for non-normal distributions
- Providing both: Allows reader to assess distribution shape

**If Mean ≈ Median:** Symmetric distribution ✓
**If Mean > Median:** Right-skewed (positive outliers)
**If Mean < Median:** Left-skewed (negative outliers)
