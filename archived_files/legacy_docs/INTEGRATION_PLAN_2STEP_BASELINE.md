Integration Plan: 2-Step Baseline Method for Production System
=============================================================

GOAL: Integrate our refined 2-step baseline method and comprehensive metrics 
      into the existing PeakForceLogger workflow without disrupting current logging.

ARCHITECTURE:
1. AutomatedLayerLogger: Continues saving raw CSV backups (unchanged)
2. PeakForceLogger: Enhanced to use our 2-step baseline method
3. Data Flow: Raw data → Enhanced Analysis → Comprehensive CSV output

KEY BENEFITS:
- No temporary CSV files needed per layer
- All analysis happens in memory during print
- Comprehensive metrics saved to PeakForce_Log.csv
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Production-ready integration

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
=======================

Option 1: UPDATE EXISTING EnhancedAdhesionAnalyzer 
-----------------------------------------------
✅ Pros: 
   - Minimal code changes
   - Preserves existing structure
   - Easy integration
   
⚠️ Considerations:
   - Need to update enhanced_adhesion_metrics.py with our methods
   - Ensure compatibility with current PeakForceLogger calls

Option 2: CREATE NEW TwoStepBaselineAnalyzer
-----------------------------------------
✅ Pros:
   - Clean implementation of our exact methods
   - No risk of breaking existing functionality
   - Can be toggled on/off easily
   
⚠️ Considerations:
   - Requires adding new analyzer option to PeakForceLogger
   - Need to update CSV headers accordingly

RECOMMENDED: Option 2 - New Analyzer
===================================

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1. Create TwoStepBaselineAnalyzer with our exact methods
2. Update PeakForceLogger to support analyzer selection
3. Add comprehensive CSV headers for all metrics
4. Test with both datasets to verify results
5. Update Prince_Segmented to enable enhanced analysis

METRICS TO INCLUDE:
==================
From our analysis sessions, include:

CORE METRICS:
- Peak Force (N)
- Work of Adhesion (mJ) 
- Propagation End Time (using max 2nd derivative)
- Baseline Force (using traditional averaging)

ENHANCED TIMING:
- Peak Time (s)
- Propagation Duration (s) 
- Max 1st Derivative Time (steepest descent)
- Max 2nd Derivative Time (max acceleration)

DERIVATIVE ANALYSIS:
- Min 1st Derivative Value (N/s)
- Max 2nd Derivative Value (N/s²)
- First Derivative Zero Crossings

ADVANCED METRICS:
- Force Range (peak - baseline)
- Derivative Stability Indicators
- Critical Point Analysis

DATA HANDLING:
==============
- NO separate CSV files per layer
- All analysis in memory using data buffer
- Results written to PeakForce_Log.csv when layer completes
- Raw data backup continues via AutomatedLayerLogger

Would you like me to proceed with implementing Option 2 (TwoStepBaselineAnalyzer)?
This gives us clean integration while preserving all existing functionality.
