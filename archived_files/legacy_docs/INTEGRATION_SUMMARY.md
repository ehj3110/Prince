# Two-Step Baseline Integration - COMPLETED

## Summary
âœ… **SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED** the Two-Step Baseline method into production system!

The refined 2-step baseline analysis developed during our comprehensive sessions has been fully integrated into the main production code. When you enable enhanced analysis, **all of these metrics are calculated for each layer** automatically.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. TwoStepBaselineAnalyzer Class
- **File**: `two_step_baseline_analyzer.py`
- **Purpose**: Implements the exact 2-step baseline method from our analysis
- **Step 1**: Propagation end detection using max 2nd derivative timing
- **Step 2**: Baseline calculation using traditional averaging at propagation end
- **Smoothing**: Uses `savgol_filter(window_length=3, polyorder=1)` - consistent with our analysis

### 2. Enhanced PeakForceLogger Integration
- **File**: `support_modules/PeakForceLogger.py`
- **New Parameter**: `analyzer_type="two_step_baseline"` (default)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Still supports legacy enhanced analyzer
- **Memory-Based**: Uses existing `_data_buffer` - no temporary CSV files needed

### 3. CSV Output - Your Exact Specification
**Headers (in exact order you requested):**
1. Layer_Number
2. Peak_Force_N  
3. Work_of_Adhesion_mJ
4. Pre_Initiation_Time_s
5. Propagation_Time_s  
6. Total_Peeling_Time_s
7. Distance_to_Peel_Start_mm
8. Distance_to_Full_Peel_mm
9. Peak_Retraction_Force_N *(relative to baseline)*
10. Pre_Peel_Force_N *(force before exposure begins)*
11. Raw_Peak_Force_Reading_N *(raw sensor reading)*
12. Baseline_Reading_N *(baseline force value)*

## How to Use

### For New Projects (Recommended)
```python
# This is now the DEFAULT behavior
logger = PeakForceLogger("output.csv", enhanced_analysis=True)
# Uses TwoStepBaselineAnalyzer automatically
```

### For Legacy Compatibility
```python
# Use old enhanced analyzer
logger = PeakForceLogger("output.csv", enhanced_analysis=True, analyzer_type="enhanced")
```

### Disable Enhanced Analysis
```python
# Use original simple analysis
logger = PeakForceLogger("output.csv", enhanced_analysis=False)
```

```

## Technical Details

### Analysis Flow
1. **Data Collection**: PeakForceLogger collects force/position data during layer peel
2. **Analysis Trigger**: When `stop_monitoring_and_log_peak()` is called
3. **Two-Step Analysis**: 
   - Max 2nd derivative for propagation end timing
   - Traditional averaging for baseline force value
4. **CSV Output**: All 12 metrics written to CSV in exact order specified

### Key Features
- **Consistent Smoothing**: Same parameters as our refined analysis 
- **Robust Detection**: Handles edge cases and invalid data
- **Memory Efficient**: No temporary files per layer
- **Production Ready**: Integrated into existing workflow without disruption

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `two_step_baseline_analyzer.py` - Core analyzer implementation
- `test_two_step_integration.py` - Integration validation
- `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

### Modified Files  
- `support_modules/enhanced_adhesion_metrics.py` - Added analyzer factory
- `support_modules/PeakForceLogger.py` - Added two-step baseline support

## Next Steps

**The integration is COMPLETE and ready for production use!**

1. **Current behavior**: When you enable enhanced analysis in your print runs, the system will automatically use the TwoStepBaselineAnalyzer
2. **CSV output**: Will contain all 12 metrics in the exact order you specified
3. **No workflow changes**: Your existing AutomatedLayerLogger calls will work unchanged

The refined analysis that fixed the 0.02-0.06s timing errors is now your production system! ðŸŽ‰
